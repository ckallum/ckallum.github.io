        <p class="author-date">March, 30 2025 Callum Ke</p>

        <p>
          During the pandemic, I found myself in a debate with a friend (I'll call him Bob) about
          lockdown policies and how the general population in Britain would react. Bob and I particularly disagreed
          on two points: first, whether public sentiment would vary based on region and/or country;
          and second, whether people had become numb to or simply didn't care about the rising death counts across the
          country.

          I was positive on the former and negative on the latter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given my admitted boredom after submitting my thesis and wanting to prove a point.
          It was only right to kill two birds with one stone by doing the thing. Did this end up taking a lot longer
          than I
          though? Yes. Did I learn something? I think so.
          Was I right? Well let's not spoil that just yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Needless to say, please do take any conclusions I make with a heavy tablespoon of salt. Again,
          this was to prove a point to my friend and not supposed to be submitted to a scientific journal.
          You'll understand why below.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting good data is hard.</h2>
        <p>
          Okay we all understand the importance of data but boy did I not prepare myself how hard it was to actually
          compile a
          useful set of data and prepare it for analysis.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Twitter(now X)</strong>. What a pain. Good thing I found <a
            href="https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape"> <em>snscrape</em></a>
          to get around the rate limiting. I compiled two set of Tweet's(X's?) relating to COVID and lockdown, labelled
          by geocode and date. Admittedly I could've
          used this curated <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03688">dataset by Panacea</a> but alas.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>UK Geographic Data. </strong> Why is this so difficult to find a centralised source? I had
          to use three different data sources(ONS, Met Office, City Population) all with different formats and for some
          reason county definitions aren't consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>UK COVID Statistics. </strong> dot gov and Public Health Wales did it's job here. Thankfully we have
          open repositories for COVID stats. I was looking for deaths and number of infections.
          But Northern Ireland why didn't you have anything I could find?
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Event's.</strong> Used the Guardian API. Prop's to them for maintaining it. Though admittedly the
          outlet has a particular political leaning.
        </p>

        <h2>Evaluating sentiment is not an exact science.</h2>
        <p> Honestly, I had no experience with NLP and never really had any interest in the field (note: this is
          pre-ChatGPT and the LLM boom).
          However, it was admittedly quite fun to experiment with various libraries and models. It was also ammusing to
          see the
          differences between them. Nothing better than finding correlation's you didn't predict.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used the following sentiment analysis methods.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vader:</strong> rule-based model, small dictionary size(missing = neutral sentiment) but does
            allow for emoji's, acronyms and slang which is particularly useful for the British lexicon and Tweets.</li>
          <li><strong>LSTM:</strong> deep-learning based model using a RNN and a standard soft-max activation function.
          </li>
          <li><strong>TextBlob:</strong> simple model, similar to Vader but doesn't work for the social-media lingo.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> probablistic model as you can guess by the name. Assume's the position of
            the word is irrelevant/independent of it's effect.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's a quick comparison of how they compared over both Tweet data-sets. Note: I normalised the sentiment
          values across
          models for better comparison.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
        <p>
          Interestingly the peaks and trough's are pretty consistent between models and the sentiment
          is mostly positive between models. Naive-Bayes is perhaps overly optimistic?</p>

          lock-down trends down over time.

        <h2>Who was right?</h2>

        <h3>Regional Sentiment Variations</h3>
        <p>
          One clear trend is that Scotlandâ€™s sentiment is almost
          always below England and Wales. My hypothesis was that
          stricter and more prolonged
          periods of lockdown endured in Scotland would result in suppresion
          of the populations mood over time. If you didn't know Scotland and England
          have separate parliaments(as do the other devolved nations) but the animosity
          between these two countries are particularly harsh.

          I also had a sneaky suspicion that
          the Scottish population were less likely to be happy with Boris Johnson due to
          the political climate (Brexit, Indepedence etc). Callum 1-0 Bob

          Ayrshire and Fife were the grumpiest counties. As an "Auld Reekie"
          i.e. someone from Edinburgh (<em>translation: Old Stinky due to the fumes in the
            Old Town back way before I was born</em>), I find it funny that our neighbours are
          so vocally angry on Twitter. Though I guess this doesn't differ much from their day-to-day attitude.

        <h3>Numb-ness to Deaths and Infections</h3>

        <p>
          Sticking with Scotland, though the trends are broadly the same across England,
          Wales and Northern Ireland, you may observe some clear patterns. At the start of June,
          COVID deaths had decreased by 75% from the previous peak in April. This coincided
          with the beginnings of an upward trend in how the public were feeling. Throughout June
          and July, sentiment remained above average. Brit's do love their time in the sun after all.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          However, through August, sentiment began to decrease substantially, reaching its lowest point
          since May 30th. The correlation between public sentiment and pandemic-related
          deaths and cases is strong between January and February. During these months, sentiment remained
          low as COVID deaths reached an all-time high. This peak in deaths corresponded with the lowest sentiment
          recorded since November. By the end of February, as COVID deaths decreased by 60% from their all-time high,
          sentiment began to recover.

        <p>
          Making use of Guardian's News API, we can figure out why certain
          dates stood out.
          The day with the lowest lockdown sentiment was the 3rd
          of January 2021. This is also the day
          Boris Johnson announced that coronavirus restrictions would
          likely get tougher.
        </p>

          <img src="./images/lockdown-sentiment-rates-england.png">
          <p class="chart-note">[England, Naive-Bayes] Lockdown Sentiment versus Covid Rates</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The day with the highest Covid sentiment across the UK
          was the 21st of March 2020. Again the Prime Minister Boris Johnson
          announced the people of the UK can â€™turn the tide of coronavirusâ€™ within 12 weeks.</p>

        <div class="visualization-container">
          <img src="./images/covid-sentiment-rates-england.png">
          <p class="chart-note">[England, Naive-Bayes] COVID Sentiment versus Covid Rates</p>
        </div>

        <p>
          On the 3rd of October, Dominic Raab announced that he
          feared Boris Johnson might die when he was taken into
          intensive care. Though I was half expecting Scotland to rejoice. But alas.
          The next day would only worsen: Scotlandâ€™s COVID cases doubling in a
          week; the Prime Minister saying the road to Christmas will
          be â€™bumpyâ€™; Conservative members turn on Boris Johnson
          over the handling of the pandemic and a document
          revealing plans for different local lockdown tiers is leaked.
          Understandably, these events caused the lowest recorded
          sentiment for the whole of the UK on the 4th of October.
          Not great.

        <p>I may as well give you this graph given that Vader enables the functionality. I'll leave it up-to you for
          interpretation.
