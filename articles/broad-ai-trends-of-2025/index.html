        <p class="author-date">March 18, 2025 · Callum Ke</p>

        <p>
          The reader will likely be aware that AI has blossomed as of late. The technical among us
          will be the first to jump to the paper "Attention is All You Need", the birth-place of the transformer as
          the real foundational breakthrough but I urge the reader to take a step back and be honest with themselves.
          In reality what really brings theory into the mainstream is consumer utitlity. ChatGPT was that catalyst,
          a humble blank text box that opened the door of generative models to the public and brought back the dream
          of AGI.

        </p>

        <p>
          Jump to 2025 and the industry finds itself at a crossroads. Recent developments in foundation models,
          resulted in massive (projected) investment in computational infrastructure have accelerated market adoption across
          industries and has drastically changed the global landscape around data-centre's, in-house chips and new energy 
          initiatives. 

          Co-incided with the large increase of venture-capital in-flows and outsized valuations in
          the start-up landscape, democratrisation of access to SOTA models enables the ability for rapid creation
          and iteration. However, this comes with the baggage of new questions around regulatory
          frameworks, competitive dynamics, and sustainable growth trajectories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reverting to the overly-used gold rush analogy,
          we must ask the question if there are still undiscovered gems to be mined and if so, how many more 
          axes do we need?
          Or, is it time for the consumer to reap the rewards of the resources that have been discovered? 
          The decision is still out with the jury.
        </p>

        <h2 id="broad-ai-market-trends">The Present</h2>

        <p>The AI market has seen (robust?) expansion across both consumer and enterprise segments, with varying
          adoption rates per industry vertical. One can imagine the potential in advancing medical diagnostics, aiding in novel research breakthroughs,
          personalized education systems and optimised compliance/legal/financial tooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the consumer-facing AI has become increasingly embedded in daily digital experiences through agentic workflows. Software development times
          has been cut in half and the agency for individuals to create has never been greater. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As an aside, AI applications are being built with the aim to remove <em>mundane</em> tasks in-order to give the end-user more
         <strong>agency</strong>, to become more efficient and enjoy doing the things that matter. 
          Currently, we are riding a fine line both in reality and sentiment of <strong> building tools that make end-users lazier and possibly dumber
          in all aspects.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Global AI market projections indicate continued strong growth across major markets:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The United States maintains its leadership position in fundamental research and enterprise AI adoption
          </li>
          <li>China has accelerated its domestic AI ecosystem development despite export control constraints</li>
          <li>The European Union has established a distinctive regulatory approach that emphasizes responsible AI
            development</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A detailed comparison between Chinese-developed GPUs and export-controlled NVIDIA GPUs reveals performance
          differences in key benchmarks relevant to AI training and inference. These technical disparities have
          significant implications for AI development capabilities across different markets.</p>

        <h2 id="export-controls">Export Controls and Geopolitical Impacts</h2>

        <p>Current export control regimes have created a bifurcated development environment for advanced AI systems,
          with particular impact on hardware access, research collaboration, and talent mobility. The recent success of
          Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek, despite these restrictions, has intensified debate about the effectiveness
          and long-term implications of such controls.</p>

        <h3 id="current-control-landscape">Current Control Landscape</h3>

        <p>Since 2022, the United States has implemented progressively stricter controls on advanced semiconductor
          exports to China, particularly targeting high-performance GPUs used for AI training. These measures have
          evolved through multiple rounds of restrictions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>October 2022: Initial controls focusing on advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing
            equipment</li>
          <li>October 2023: Expanded controls lowering performance thresholds and closing loopholes, affecting Nvidia
            H800 and A800 chips previously designed for the Chinese market</li>
          <li>2024: Further refinements targeting emerging technologies and expanded end-use restrictions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These controls have created distinct technology environments between China and Western markets, forcing
          companies on both sides to adapt their strategies significantly.</p>

        <h3 id="deepseek-case-study">The DeepSeek Case Study</h3>

        <p>DeepSeek's success provides a valuable case study of how Chinese AI companies are adapting to export control
          constraints. According to reports, DeepSeek may have access to approximately 50,000 Hopper-generation chips,
          including a mix of H100s, H800s, and H20s. This hardware arsenal has enabled them to train competitive models
          at significantly lower costs than their Western counterparts.</p>

        <p>As Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, noted in his analysis: "It appears that a substantial fraction of
          DeepSeek's AI chip fleet consists of chips that haven't been banned (but should be); chips that were shipped
          before they were banned; and some that seem very likely to have been smuggled."</p>

        <p>This mixed hardware environment highlights both the successes and limitations of the current export control
          regime:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Export controls have successfully limited access to cutting-edge H100 GPUs, forcing companies to work with
            less powerful alternatives</li>
          <li>Timing gaps between control announcements and implementations created windows for stockpiling</li>
          <li>China has developed alternative supply chains, though with significant performance trade-offs</li>
          <li>Chinese companies have adapted by investing heavily in algorithmic and architectural innovations to
            maximize efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="adaptive-strategies">Adaptive Strategies Under Constraints</h3>

        <p>The bifurcated development environment has led to distinctive approaches to AI development in China versus
          the West:</p>

        <h4>Chinese Adaptations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Innovations:</strong> Companies like DeepSeek have pioneered techniques such as
            Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) and optimized MoE architectures to maximize performance with limited computing
            resources</li>
          <li><strong>Domestic Hardware Development:</strong> Accelerated investment in alternatives like Huawei Ascend
            chips, though these still lag significantly behind NVIDIA's performance</li>
          <li><strong>Targeted Applications:</strong> Focus on domains where compute constraints have less impact, such
            as specialized vertical applications</li>
          <li><strong>Open Source Leverage:</strong> Building upon open-source foundations to accelerate development
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Western Strategic Response:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scale Advantage:</strong> Continuing to leverage abundant computing resources to push the
            boundaries of model size and capabilities</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory Alignment:</strong> Developing compliance frameworks that maintain access to global
            markets</li>

            significant technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="future-scenarios">Future Scenarios and Implications</h3>

        <p>Looking ahead, several potential scenarios could shape the evolution of the AI hardware landscape and export
          controls:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Bipolar Development:</strong> Both China and the US maintain competitive AI ecosystems with
            divergent technological approaches, leading to decreased interoperability and parallel innovation paths</li>
          <li><strong>Increasing Control Effectiveness:</strong> More comprehensive controls could widen the gap between
            Chinese and Western AI capabilities, especially as next-generation hardware (like NVIDIA's Blackwell
            architecture) becomes essential for cutting-edge research</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Revolution:</strong> Constraints could drive fundamental breakthroughs in computational
            efficiency that eventually benefit the entire field</li>
          <li><strong>Graduated Controls:</strong> More nuanced restrictions targeting only the most sensitive
            applications while allowing controlled technology flow for commercial and research uses</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As Amodei argues: "Making AI that is smarter than almost all humans at almost all things will require
          millions of chips, tens of billions of dollars (at least), and is most likely to happen in 2026-2027." This
          timeline creates urgency for both sides of the export control debate.</p>

        <h3 id="investment-implications">Investment Implications</h3>

        <p>For investment managers, this bifurcated landscape creates both challenges and opportunities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supply Chain Complexity:</strong> Investments in AI hardware must account for increasingly complex
            regulatory environments and the potential for sudden changes</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Premium:</strong> Companies developing technologies that improve computational
            efficiency may command premium valuations</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic Strategy:</strong> Portfolio construction must consider the increasing divergence
            between Chinese and Western technology ecosystems</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory Expertise:</strong> Deep understanding of export control regimes becomes a competitive
            advantage for investors operating across markets</li>
          <li><strong>Hardware Diversification:</strong> Investments in alternative chip designs and architectures may
            provide hedges against geopolitical risks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, while export controls have created meaningful constraints on Chinese AI development, they have
          not fundamentally halted progress. Instead, they have shaped a distinctive development environment that
          produces different types of innovation with potentially far-reaching consequences for global technology
          competition.</p>
