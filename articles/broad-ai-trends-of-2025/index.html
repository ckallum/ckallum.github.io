        <p class="author-date">March 18, 2025 · Callum Ke</p>

        <p>
          The reader will likely be aware that AI has been blossoming. The technical among us
          will be the first to jump to the paper "Attention is All You Need", the birth-place of the transformer as
          the real foundational breakthrough but I urge the reader to take a step back and be honest with themselves.
          In reality what really brings theory into the mainstream is consumer utitlity. ChatGPT was that catalyst,
          a humble blank text box that opened the door of generative models to the public and brought back the dream
          of AGI. One can now imagine advancing medical diagnostics, aiding in novel research breakthroughs,
          personalized education systems and optimised compliance/legal/financial tooling.
        </p>

        <p>
          We must ask the question if the proverbial flower of AI is still blooming with the potential yet to be
          full displayed, or perphaps we are at this seasons full bloom and now is the time for the flower to be picked
          such that the consumer can reap the rewards?
          Or has growth been stunted due to the harsh surrounding environment where perhaps we may need to wait for
          another season?
          The decision is still yet to be made by the gardener.
        </p>

        <h2 id="broad-ai-market-trends">The Present</h2>

        <p>
          Jump to 2025 and the industry finds itself at a pivotal moment. Development in foundation models has been fast
          flowing,
          with each new model leap frogging over the previous iteration.
          This has been a result of massive investment in computational infrastructure which has drastically changed the
          global investment and political landscape in order to accommodate for the needs of AI now and in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the industry is riding a fine line. What happens if we are building out supply to accommodate
          for demand that may not exist. Microsoft's Satya Nadella recently raised skepticism of mass investments
          without
          an end goal, signalling a shift in order to prioritise sustainable growth trajectories.

        </p>

        <p>
          It is undeniable that there
          is a trickling fear and resentment in both sentiment and in reality that AI is removing human agency and
          creativity,
          resulting in laziness, demoralisation and neglect for quality outcomes.

          The mandate is now to build applications that aim to remove <em>mundane</em> tasks in-order to give
          the end-user more
          <strong>agency</strong>, to become more efficient and enjoy doing the things that matter.
        </p>


        <h2 id="key-players">Key Players</h2>

        <p>The global dynamic currently looks like:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The United States maintains its leadership position in fundamental research, enterprise and consumer AI
            adoption through its start-up and VC culture.
          </li>
          <li>
            China has accelerated its domestic AI ecosystem development through its big corporations and is paving its
            own way, determined not to be left behind despite export control constraints. </li>
          <li>
            The European Union has established a distinctive regulatory approach that emphasizes responsible AI
            development working with the big players around the world.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="western-tech-giants"> The US: The Magnificent Seven</h3>

        <p>Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA and Tesla continue to dominate the AI landscape through
          their combined market power and monopoly over computational resources and talent. Each has carved out
          distinctive AI strategies:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Microsoft has leveraged its OpenAI partnership to integrate AI capabilities across its enterprise and SAAS
            products.
            Though arguably, Satya Nadella has been downplaying sentiment towards AI investments as of late, with a
            shift in focus towards
            sustainable growth and concrete revenue's.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alphabet is the R&D giant. Merging with their research arm DeepMind, their suite of Gemini products
            alongside G-Suite has
            arguably made the most consumer impact. With the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, they are now the leader across
            many benchmarks
            for foundational models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meta carves out it niche with open-source multimodal foundation models and is openly investing heavily into
            the space. However,
            LlaMMa has seen to be falling behind. </li>
          <li>
            Amazon continues it's tread as the "do it all company" focusing on AI integration in all customer facing
            verticles such as retail, devices, robotics and developers.
            AWS BedRock is the ultimate SOTA model marketplace, allowing developers in the AWS eco-system to use models
            out of the box.
            Their hidden gem is the progress they are making with chip development especially on the training and
            inference side as well as massive scale-out in
            data-centers to serve models.
          </li>
          <li>
            NVIDIA has solidified its position as the essential infrastructure provider for GPU's and data-centers. It
            would be an understatement to say no-one comes close
            to competing with them when it comes to GPU performance and software integration for their GPU's.
            Development has not stopped, their pipeline is already in place for
            the next 3 years and the sheer demand can be seen by the number of enterprise partnerships they have from
            their GTM conference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tesla has long tried to remarket themselves as an AI and software company, justifying its larger valuations
            compared
            to its other traditional piers. Their focus is still widly on ADV though arguably lagging behind
            Waymo(Google) and
            the evergrowing BYD. It seems now they are trying to be the fore-front in the robotics space with Optimus.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Boutique's</h3>

        <p>
          The (mostly) privately funded research firms are akin to traditional fashion houses. Gucci, Prada and LV set
          the
          fashion trend for each season. Their ideas, once displayed, trickle down to cheaper and perhaps more
          consumer-accessible fashion retailers.

          We can view OpenAI, Anthropic and now DeepSeek as the same tone setters, each with their own flavour, taking
          the risks and pushing boundaries
          on SOTA(state-of-the-art) models. Their techniques are then quickly adopted and tweaked by the open-source
          community. Once this happens,
          the demand of once was considered SOTA (see Claude-3.5 or DeepSeek 3) falls drastically and margins decrease.
          This fear of falling behind
          is what keeps these firms raking in capital in order to push the frontier and establish themselves as the main
          player in the AI race.
        </p>

          The global distribution of AI computational infrastructure investment and research continues to reflect both
          market demand globally.
          Data center capacity has expanded significantly in key regions including North
          America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with particular growth in infrastructure optimized for AI workloads. Yes,
          data-centers are not just
          for AI. Have people really forgotten about the "Cloud"?

        <p>The GPU market remains dominated by NVIDIA, though competitive dynamics are evolving in the supply chain,
          with both established
          semiconductor companies and new entrants developing specialized AI chips. Chip production and design has been
          monopolised by a small set of companies within Taiwan and the Netherlands(TSMC, ASML).
          However, with export controls and geo-political dynamics, China has found a need to invest in domestic chip
          production. Noticeably, Huawei and Shenzen SiCarrier
          are trying to replicate the major players in GPU's(Huawei Ascend) and 28nm/5nm chips(via domestic DUV lithography machines).

        <p>As Dario Amodei argues(CEO Anthropic): "Making AI that is smarter than almost all humans at almost all things
          will require
          millions of chips, tens of billions of dollars (at least), and is most likely to happen in 2026-2027." This
          timeline creates urgency for both sides of the export control debate.</p>

        Below are some criteria worth considering when looking at the landscape in China:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supply Chain Complexity:</strong> Investments in AI hardware must account for increasingly complex
            regulatory environments and the potential for sudden changes</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency Premium:</strong> Companies developing technologies that improve computational
            efficiency may command premium valuations</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory Expertise:</strong> Deep understanding of export control regimes becomes a competitive
            advantage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="inference-reasoning">The Rise of Reasoning</h2>

        <p>AI models have evolved rapidly from pattern recognition, to generation to sophisticated reasoning
          capabilities.
          OpenAI opened the doors with GPT-o1 while DeepSeek raised the sealing with DeepSeek-R1.
        </p>

        <p>Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated unprecedented reasoning capabilities—the ability
          to process information through multiple logical steps, evaluate evidence, and generate novel insights. This
          represents a fundamental shift beyond traditional pattern recognition.</p>

        <p>Reasoning capabilities that distinguish advanced models include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Multi-step logical reasoning through complex problems</li>
          <li>Generating and evaluating multiple solution paths</li>
          <li>Incorporating external tools and knowledge sources</li>
          <li>Explaining decision processes in human-understandable terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="current-bottlenecks">What Stops Reasoning</h3>

        <p>Despite remarkable progress, several critical bottlenecks constrain both the development and deployment of
          reasoning-capable AI systems:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Computational Efficiency:</strong> Reasoning operations require significantly more compute
            resources than traditional inference, with corresponding increases in latency and cost</li>
          <li><strong>Memory Bandwidth:</strong> Advanced reasoning requires maintaining and manipulating complex state
            information, creating memory bottlenecks in current hardware architectures</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> The energy requirements for reasoning operations grow non-linearly
            with model complexity, creating sustainability challenges</li>
          <li><strong>Specialized Hardware:</strong> Current accelerators optimized for matrix multiplication operations
            are suboptimal for the sparse, conditional computation patterns of reasoning workflows</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However these constraints create significant opportunities for improvement across several domains.
          According to research by <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-reasoning-perspective/"
            target="_blank">Sequoia Capital</a>, investment in reasoning-specific AI technologies increased by 218% in
          2024, reflecting the market's recognition of this critical capability. <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935" target="_blank">Recent technical analysis</a> suggests that
          reasoning capabilities may follow a distinct scaling trajectory from general model size, creating
          opportunities for specialized approaches.</p>

        <h3 id="hbm-memory">The Critical Role of HBM Memory</h3>

        <p>High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) has emerged as a critical component for advanced AI systems, particularly those
          focused on reasoning capabilities. This specialized memory architecture addresses the significant bandwidth
          requirements of complex AI workloads by stacking memory dies vertically and connecting them with
          through-silicon vias (TSVs).</p>

        <p>Key advantages of HBM over traditional GDDR memory include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bandwidth Improvements:</strong> HBM offers 3-7x greater memory bandwidth than GDDR6X, enabling
            more efficient data access during complex reasoning operations</li>
          <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> HBM consumes approximately 50% less power per bit transferred compared
            to GDDR alternatives</li>
          <li><strong>Spatial Efficiency:</strong> The stacked die architecture allows for greater memory capacity in a
            smaller footprint, critical for data center density</li>
          <li><strong>Context Window Support:</strong> HBM's bandwidth and capacity are essential for supporting the
            extended context windows that enable sophisticated reasoning across long documents or multiple sources</li>
        </ul>
